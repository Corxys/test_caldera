# Technical assessment

## Introduction
This technical assessment is about testing your strengths in three main categories that relate
to what a full stack developer at Caldera may do.  
The first part, “Javascript” alternates questions of several levels of difficulty. You will have to
surf between a wide range of topics while showing a certain comprehension of the language
functioning.  
“Vue.js” and “Style” parts are easier. You will have to demonstrate that you’re able to follow
standards, respect good practices and propose solutions to some technical problems.  
You can give back any file you want: a docx/pdf file, or a code file containing the answers.  
The duration of the test is about 1 to 2 hours.  
Good luck!
